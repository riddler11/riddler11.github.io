Try to select the components that control the trolley. As the title： Main control chip：AT89C52 chip A toy car（which have two motor.The front motor controls the left and right, and the rear motor controls the front and rear） A chip or module that controls a motor：L298/L9110 Wireless module：NRF24L01（If you like, you can use ESP8266 networking control or HC05 Bluetooth control） Drop-Out Voltage-Regulator module：5V to 3.3V（The voltage used in NRF24L01 is 3.3V） The next step is to draw circuit diagram You can use your hand or some software to draw, this step is to know what you want. The minimum system is the core of the hardware circuit design.Because of this you should design the minimum system first. And then design the switch and power .With the power and switch single chip microcomputer can work. In China you can not only buy components by using TaoBao, but also use it to see some reference details of the components. For example, the control motor chip on this article, you can see the reference details below Taobao such as：How does L298 work and so on. In this step you can figure out how the components work Next is to connect the chips and modles with the single chip microcomputer. Tips: Remember to reserve the port to upload the code.Otherwise, it's a headache if you don't keep the port to upload you have to remove the chip to upload it everytime. You can use a IDC connector(such as 10pin X9555WV-2X05-6TV01) and a USB TO RS232/485/TTLto upload your code. After completing the above steps, you can start drawing PCB Draw PCB according to your own circuit diagram.(I use DXP to draw PCB) Of course, DXP provides a tool that can draw circuit schematic diagrams.You can use it directly to draw the schematic diagram and the schematic library. After painting, remember to check whether the connection is connected, etc Proofing Send the design drawings to the factory, and the factory will help you proofing. After welding,then you can debug. 2.Code debug Complete the above design You can simulation in protues before you upload the code in the chip. This method can simulate the running state of hardware under real conditions. The first thing to do is to let the car move. When the trolley moves, first prove that the trolley motor is OK, and then there can be a later control activity. If the car can't move, check the problem maybe the motor problem , maybe the L298 problem or some problems with the circuit board be good at using multimeter at this time. The motor test is very simple. Connect it with a battery to see if it will move.（It is better to connect a resistor in series. In case of excessive current, the motor may burn during the detection process。） Other part use a multimeter to check whether there is electricity or not 。 The next step is to debug the control code NRF24L01 is used to control in the design, so pay attention to the voltage The voltage of 51 single chip microcomputer is 5V, and this module is 3.3V If the module burns out, it is impossible to control it。 Assuming that the computer controls, the computer is the information sending end and the single chip microcomputer is the information receiving end Single control first（such as go forward, P2.0 port is 0, P2.1 port is 1, and the single chip microcomputer receives the signal &quot;1&quot;） In the computer, use the serial port debugging assistant to send the signal of 1 Key code examples of single chip microcomputer if( rece_buf[1]=='1') //After the first bit is the received command data, rece_buf[0] is the length of data bits. { M0=0； //sbit M0 = P2^0 sbit M1 = P2^1 M1=1； } Proceed to the next step after successful debugging Reverse, stop, left turn and right turn control are completed in the same way.Then implementation the project.

Its original design purpose is to improve the accuracy of statistics and facilitate the students on duty to watch the clock in every day, thus producing the idea of making this system. It has been put into use System architecture The system architecture is expanded based on MVC development mode, including database data layer, model layer, Dao data persistence layer, service business logic layer and controller / servlet controller. The division of labor at each level is clear and the coupling degree of levels is reduced. View layer The system adopts B / S mode. Most display pages are JSP / HTML. In order to meet the display of page UI, ajax data exchange is in JSON format. This layer is closely combined with the control layer, and they need to work together. Controller layer The controller layer is responsible for the control of specific business module processes, which not only makes the program structure clear, but also greatly reduces the amount of code. The control layer is mainly used to respond to client requests. Whenever a request is sent to the system, the control layer will call the corresponding business logic. There are many kinds of requests, such as ajax data request, page request, file upload and file download. The control layer will make corresponding data return, page Jump and stream return. Data persistence layer The Dao layer mainly does the work of the data persistence layer, and some tasks responsible for contacting the database are encapsulated here. The design of the Dao layer first designs the Dao interface, and then designs the implementation class. Contact of each layer The Dao layer can be developed independently with low mutual coupling, and can be carried out independently. Such a mode has particular advantages in the process of developing large projects. The controller and view layers need to be developed together because of their high coupling, but they can also be developed as a whole independent of the first two layers. In this way, we only need to know the definition of the interface between layers, and call the interface to complete the required logical unit application. Everything is very clear and simple. The following figure shows the current website functional architecture Gitee download address, click here directly，This code is still the code with bug before. Understanding the code and making corresponding modifications will make great progress. The code here is developed using the following software：Development tool：MyEclipse10，Database：MySQL 5.1.32-community，Graphical interface database operation：navicat，Java environment：jdk1.8.0_131. Later, I used eclipse to develop，When JDK6 is changed to a higher version in MyEclipse, some errors will occur in MyEclipse. There is no file class requested by image processing. Anyway, if two jdk version exist, it will causing some code bugs; Like not executing identification codes or something. Bug in the orignal project The number of clocking days is increased to 100 when it reaches 99 days, and the data of 99 days is checked and modified all the time. The process and Realization of clock in days In the point entry interface, fill in the scores, or upload pictures for identification. After there is content in the input box, click upload, and the clock in days will increase automatically. The personal design is realized by comparing the time. The registration time will be automatically recorded during registration, and then the clock in days will be calculated by comparing with the registration time. Three cases： Clock in on the day of registration Didn't clock in on the day of registration Clock in after registration The details should be combined with the code The reason for the bug is when designing the database，The data type is varchar(255), And then on day 99, The code always judges 99 as the maximum number of days. My personal idea to solve this bug is(Judge the latest clock in number, because the clock in number increases automatically and the data type is int).When I write here, I suddenly remember that the number of branch days seems to be of varchar type. I'll change this when I'm free. When the project is uploaded to the server and run, the bugs are more interesting. No problem with local database entry. But when the server uploads Chinese into the database, it is garbled.（Add useunicode = true &amp; characterencoding = UTF-8 in db.properties to solve the problem）Problem solving link The JDK of Tomcat 7 version is only 1.7. The algorithms of image processing cannot be used. As shown in the figure, an error will be reported The tomacat 8 version is finally ready for JDK1.8, and the feelings entered in the result are all ？？？？？（garbled），Check the data on the Internet and find that tomcat8 can directly help you deal with the problem of characters. It defaults to UTF-8. My method transcodes the tomcat7 version into iso-8859-1. In order not to cause great changes, I changed the code to ISO-8859-1。Problem solving link 4.The best bug is nothing more than this. I developed this project using the windows operating system. The storage directory path is shown as the forward slash“\\” However, the actual server is a Linux system. Let's take a look at the server without changing the code（See the figure below） img\\学号\\图片名 (Surprise, it has created a strange folder that can't be accessed yet). Next, let's look at the actual storage path of the server. As shown in the figure, the backslash &quot;/&quot; is used for storage.As a result, storage problems arise，The solution is to change the forward slash to the backslash Places to be promoted In the points interface, you can add number of days to punch to compare with the actual number of days to punch.In fact, I wrote this part of the code method myself, but there were a few small problems when I actually wrote it on the front end, and I don't have time to solve them yet. This website can actually be converted into wechat applet to clock in，Capable students or students who want to have this ability can learn from the database structure and code written by my back-end and use them to achieve. Genius can be ignored and developed directly on demand. I implement image processing here by using the API provided by others. Low recognition rate is a problemThis is also the knowledge what I lack You can add functions such as meeting sign in. Make the software more rich and humanized Finally, I attached the supply and demand analysis of the small program I wanted to make at that time The above is written on November 3, 2020.

The burning circuit in the new version is no problem, and the computer can recognize it successfully Because they were too confident and didn't buy more components, it was difficult to check where there were errors in the first board, and they didn't check the schematic diagram well. Buying fewer components resulted in not having to weld three resistors.

The preliminary analysis is that the internal components will divide the voltage and fail to reach the rated voltage, resulting in failure to work normally. It is necessary to analyze and calculate the circuit to solve this problem.

Drawing is the Arduino uno board. Including four part circuits（Power supply circuit, Comparison circuit, USB Download circuit and AVR single chip microcomputer circuit） The comparison circuit is the most interesting part I think. Compare the USB power supply with DC power supply through lm358, and select the power side. Because there happened to be a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor nearby, I decided to write a small code to test it. #include &lt;dht11.h&gt;//Temperature and humidity head file. You have to download this head file #define DHT11PIN 2 //D2 is defined as the data output port dht11 DHT11; void setup() { // put your setup code here, to run once: Serial.begin(9600);//Define baud rate pinMode(DHT11PIN,OUTPUT); //Set D2 as data output } void loop() { // put your main code here, to run repeatedly: temp = analogRead(Aout); //Read analog data of A0 pin String a=String(temp); int chk = DHT11.read(DHT11PIN); //Assign the read value to chk int tem=(float)DHT11.temperature; //Assign the temperature value to tem int hum=(float)DHT11.humidity; //Assign humidity value to hum Serial.print(&quot;Tempeature:&quot;); //Print out the Temperature: Serial.print(tem); //Print temperature results Serial.println(&quot;°c&quot;); Serial.print(&quot;Humidity:&quot;); //Print out Humidity: Serial.print(hum); //Print out humidity results Serial.println(&quot;%&quot;); //Print out% Serial.println(&quot;&quot;); delay(500); //500 ms delay } Difficulties encountered Ams1117-5.0v will reduce the voltage, and dc005 will be less than 5V when powered by the wrong adapter(I measured it myself with a multimeter)It is better to use a 7-12V power adapter. 2.Ams1117-5.0v chip can be removed if you use dc002, or when power adapter is 5V, the chip can also be removed. When drawing the schematic diagram library and package diagram library, the schematic pin must correspond to the component pin in the package diagram library. On this basis, it should correspond to the package pin of the actual component.（If you don't do this, the wiring of the designed circuit will go wrong） The most important file download address, click here to gitee download ","link":"https://riddler11.github.io/ad-hui-zhi-arduinohan-yuan-li-tu-ji-zi-ji-yu-guo-de-keng/"}]}
